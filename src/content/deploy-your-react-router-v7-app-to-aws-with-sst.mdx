If you're looking for an alternative to Vercel that gives you more control over your infrastructure, **SST** is a great option. It lets you deploy React Router v7 apps to your own AWS account with minimal configuration.

[SST](https://sst.dev/docs/) is a framework that makes it easy to build and deploy modern full-stack applications on AWS. Think of it as a developer-friendly wrapper around AWS services that handles the complex infrastructure setup for you.

In this guide, I'll show you how to:

- Add SST to your React Router v7 project
- Deploy to AWS
- Set up a custom domain

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

1. **AWS Account** - [Create one here](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you don't have it
2. **AWS CLI installed and configured** - Follow [SST's AWS setup guide](https://sst.dev/docs/aws-accounts/)
3. **React Router v7 project** - I'll use my [starter template](https://github.com/hqasmei/react-router-v7-starter)

> ðŸ’¡ Using my template? Clone it with: git clone https://github.com/hqasmei/react-router-v7-starter.git my-project

### Step 1: Initialize SST

In your React Router v7 project directory, run:

```bash
npx sst@latest init
```

SST will detect your React Router project and prompt you:

```bash
> React Router detected. This will...
  - create an sst.config.ts
  - modify the tsconfig.json
  - add sst to package.json
? Continue:
```

**Select "Yes"** to automatically configure everything.

After initialization, you'll see these new files:

- `sst.config.ts` - SST configuration
- `.sst/` folder - SST internal files
- Updated `package.json` with SST dependencies

### Step 2: First Deployment

Now let's deploy your app to AWS:

```bash
npx sst deploy
```

**What happens during deployment:**

- SST creates AWS resources (CloudFront, Lambda, S3, etc.)
- Your React Router app gets built and deployed
- You get a live URL to test your app

This first deployment takes 3-5 minutes since AWS is creating all the infrastructure.

Once complete, you'll see output like:

```bash
âœ…  Complete
   ReactRouter: https://d1234567890.cloudfront.net
```

Your app is now live on AWS!

### Step 3: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain instead of the CloudFront URL, you need:

1. **Domain registered in AWS Route 53** (or ability to change nameservers)
2. **SSL certificate** (SST can create this automatically)
