React Router v7 brings powerful full-stack capabilities to React applications. While the default setup works great out of the box, there are a few tweaks I always make to create a cleaner, more organized project structure.

In this guide, I'll walk you through my preferred React Router v7 setup using **Framework mode**, including how to organize your code in a `src` folder and customize the development server.

## Creating Your React Router v7 Project

Let's start with the official template:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest my-react-router-app
```

When prompted, I typically choose:

- **Initialize a new git repository?** → No (I prefer setting this up manually)
- **Install dependencies with npm?** → Yes

## Why Use a src Folder Structure?

By default, React Router v7 places the `app` folder at your project root. While this works fine, I prefer organizing everything inside a `src` folder because it:

- **Keeps the root clean** - Configuration files stay at the top level while source code lives in `src`
- **Matches common React conventions** - Most React developers expect to find components and app logic in `src`
- **Improves organization** - Makes it easier to separate source code from build tools and config files
- **Scales better** - As your project grows, having a dedicated source folder prevents clutter

## Moving to src Folder Structure

Here's how to reorganize your project:

```bash
cd my-react-router-app
mkdir src
mv app src/
```

## Updating Configuration Files

After moving the `app` folder, you need to update several configuration files to point to the new location.

### 1. Update react-router.config.ts

Tell React Router where to find your app directory:

```tsx
import type { Config } from '@react-router/dev/config';

export default {
  // Config options...
  // Server-side render by default, to enable SPA mode set this to `false`
  ssr: true,
  appDirectory: './src/app',
} satisfies Config;
```

### 2. Update tsconfig.json

Update the TypeScript configuration to include the new `src` structure:

```json
{
  "include": [
    "src",
    "**/*",
    "**/.server/**/*",
    "**/.client/**/*",
    ".react-router/types/**/*"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ES2022"],
    "types": ["node", "vite/client"],
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "rootDirs": [".", "./.react-router/types"],
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

The key changes here are:

- Adding `"src"` to the `include` array
- Setting up path mapping with `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` for cleaner imports

### 3. Update vite.config.ts

The default development server runs on `localhost:5173`, but I prefer the more common `localhost:3000`. Here's how to change it in your `vite.config.ts`:

```tsx
import { reactRouter } from '@react-router/dev/vite';
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss(), reactRouter(), tsconfigPaths()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
});
```

**Why port 3000?** It's the conventional port for React development servers, and if you're coming from Create React App or Next.js, it feels more familiar.

## Final Project Structure

After these changes, your project structure will look like this:

```
my-react-router-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── root.tsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── components/     (you'll add these)
│   ├── lib/           (you'll add these)
│   ├── utils/         (you'll add these)
│   └── hooks/         (you'll add these)
├── react-router.config.ts
├── vite.config.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

## Common Folders I Add Later

Depending on the project complexity, I typically add these folders inside `src`:

- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components
- **`lib/`** - Third-party library configurations and utilities
- **`utils/`** - Pure utility functions
- **`services/`** - API calls and external service integrations
- **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks
- **`types/`** - TypeScript type definitions

## Time-Saving Template

I've created a custom template with these configurations pre-applied, so I don't have to repeat these steps for every new project.

To use it:

```tsx
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-router-v7-template.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npm install
```

You can also fork the official React Router starter and apply these changes yourself.

## Wrapping Up

These small tweaks make React Router v7 projects feel more organized and familiar, especially if you're coming from other React frameworks. The `src` folder structure keeps things tidy, and the port change makes the development experience more consistent with other React tools.
