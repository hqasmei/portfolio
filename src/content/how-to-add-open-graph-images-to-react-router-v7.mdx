When you share a link on Twitter, LinkedIn, or in a Slack message, you often see a preview with an image, title, and description. That preview image is called an **Open Graph image**.

In this guide, I'll show you how to add these link previews to your React Router v7 app.

## What Are Open Graph Images?

Open Graph images are what make links look good when shared. Instead of just showing a plain URL, platforms like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord can display:

- A preview image
- The page title
- A description
- The website name

This makes your links more clickable and professional-looking.

### Step 1: Create Your Open Graph Image

First, you need to create the actual image. Here are the specs:

**📏 Standard dimensions:** 1200x630 pixels

**🎨 Design tool:** I use Figma, but any design tool works

**💡 Pro tip:** Keep text large and readable since the image gets scaled down

### Step 2: Add Image to Your Project

Place your image in the `public` folder of your React Router v7 project:

<CodeBlock title="Public Folder Structure">
```txt
public/
├── og-images/
│   └── og-image.png
└── ...
```
</CodeBlock>

I created an `og-images` folder since you might add more images for different pages later. But up to you to name it whatever you want.

### Step 3: Update Your Route's Meta Function

Go to the route where you want the Open Graph image to appear and update the `meta` function:

<CodeBlock title="src/routes/your-route.tsx">
```tsx
export function meta({}: Route.MetaArgs) {
  return [
    { title: 'Your Page Title' },
    { name: 'description', content: 'Your page description' },

    // Open Graph meta tags
    { property: 'og:title', content: 'Your Page Title' },
    { property: 'og:description', content: 'Your page description' },
    {
      property: 'og:image',
      content: 'https://yourdomain.com/og-images/og-image.png',
    },
    { property: 'og:type', content: 'website' },
    { property: 'og:url', content: 'https://yourdomain.com/your-page' },

    // Twitter Card meta tags
    { name: 'twitter:card', content: 'summary_large_image' },
    {
      name: 'twitter:image',
      content: 'https://yourdomain.com/og-images/og-image.png',
    },
  ];
}
```
</CodeBlock>

**Important:** Replace `https://yourdomain.com` with your actual deployed website URL. The browser needs the full URL to access the image once your site is live.

### Step 4: Deploy and Test

After deploying your site, test if your Open Graph image works:

**🔍 Testing tool:** [OpenGraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz/)

Just paste your URL and see how your link preview looks!

### **Why Use Full URLs?**

You might wonder why we use the full website URL instead of just `/og-images/og-image.png`. When social media platforms or messaging apps fetch your Open Graph data, they need the complete URL to access your image from their servers.

### **Wrapping Up**

That's it! Your React Router v7 app now has professional-looking link previews. This small addition makes your content much more engaging when shared across the web.
